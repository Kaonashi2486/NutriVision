# NutriVision

We built NutriVision, a Food Scanner App that helps users make informed dietary choices. The app scans food packaging for ingredient lists and nutrition tables, deciphers complex jargon, and provides a clear recommendation on whether the product is suitable for the user. Based on the user‚Äôs personal health data, it also suggests the optimal daily consumption amount.üíñ‚ú®üçé
